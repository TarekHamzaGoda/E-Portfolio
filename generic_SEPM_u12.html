									<h3>Final Module Reflection</h3>

									<h4>What?Project Management in Computing</h4>
									<p>
										I was particularly excited to start this module as I possessed a broad understanding of project management in a general context, but I was particularly keen to delve into the particulars of managing a software project. While I had a foundational knowledge of software development methodologies like scrum, waterfall, and agile, my goal was to discover the project manager's role in applying these methodologies entirely. Therefore, my curiosity extended to exploring the organizational and risk assessment skills that a project manager must possess to successfully deliver a fully functional software product.
									</p>
									<p>
										Another exciting aspect of this module, was the prospect of working collaboratively in a team environment once again as I aimed to contribute to create a robust plan collectively with my team members or “fellow project managers”. I was eager to integrate the tools provided in this unit to manage and formulate strategies for delivering a fully functional software solution. Additionally, I looked forward to leveraging this collaborative experience to acquire valuable technical knowledge from my fellow team members as well as applying my previous experiences with project management.

									<h4>So What? The Tools of Software Project Manager</h4>
									<p>
										I was particularly excited to start this module as I possessed a broad understanding of project management in a general context, but I was particularly keen to delve into the particulars of managing a software project. While I had a foundational knowledge of software development methodologies like scrum, waterfall, and agile, my goal was to discover the project manager's role in applying these methodologies entirely. Therefore, my curiosity extended to exploring the organizational and risk assessment skills that a project manager must possess to successfully deliver a fully functional software product.
									</p>
									<p>
										The journey through the beginning of the software project management module has been an insightful exploration into the foundational principles and practices of the successful execution of software development projects. Although it seemed like there was a lot to learn in the beginning, the comprehensive step by step overview of the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) has served as roadmap for understanding all phases of generating a functional software, and has guided me into learning the effective implementation for project success. It is safe to say that the beginning of the module has laid the groundwork for a schematic approach to software management, emphasizing planning, business activities, IT activities, and the common causes of project failures.
									</p>
									<p>
										Another crucial aspect of the module in my opinion, revolved around estimation techniques, cost classifications, and gauging productivity as a software project manager. This has highlighted the importance of metrics for accounting programmer contributions such as Lines of Code (LOC) and Expert Judgment. However, I have noticed the shift in perspective that aligns with contemporary practices in which functionality is prioritized and valued over similar redundant code metrics (Imai, et al., 2002). On the other hand, estimation techniques such as COCOMO emerged as a more valuable skill for constructing a solid cost analysis which it takes into count circumstantial aspects and project constrains (Dhiman, 2020). Quality management and user experience emerged as another crucial aspect of project management principles introduced during this unit. In my opinion, the constraints of budget, time, and scope were the only potential factors affecting project quality. I think that effective communication with the stakeholders especially at the beginning phases of the project planning can assist in creating a robust user experience and solid quality throughout project development.
									</p>
									<p>
										While I learned numerous concepts throughout this module, the standout experience for me was engaging in Assignment Parts 1 and 2. These units required us to navigate a project from both a real-life and historical perspective which I think enforces the knowledge gained through the module. We were provided a selection of hardware and software components to construct a system aligning with EDC requirements, which was a somehow challenging in the beginning. My limited experience with outdated components prompted extensive research alongside my team members at the assignment's start. The reason for this is that a comprehensive understanding of the development environment was vital for effective project management and communication with stakeholders. This collective effort led us to create a set of assumptions and Gherkin statements, establishing a shared foundation to manage the project. Finally, we were encouraged to divide tasks based on individual comfort levels, in which eat team member was able to maximise their technical contributions to each task. This approach facilitated a balanced distribution of responsibilities, in which I think showcased a collaborative team dynamic.
									</p>
									<p>
										In the second part of the assignment, the focus shifted towards implementing a Python application for instant cost calculations. Inspired from the module's cost estimation methods, our team voted for COCOMO as the primary calculation algorithm for the cost calculator. Given the historical context of the project, we also incorporated Lines of Code (LOC) into our approach. While I was eager to contribute to the frontend development, I proposed to my team members to initiate the build of the Graphical User Interface (GUI) parallel with the calculation syntax, ensuring seamless integration in the future. Although we agreed that tkinter will become the primary GUI interface, I recognized the need for a Command-Line Interface (CLI) initially, allowing early code testing by my team members. While tkinter is acknowledged as a straightforward GUI builder, translating my vision into the interface posed a challenge at the start, given my limited knowledge of the full potential of tkinter methods. To address this, we held frequent meetings throughout the week, adopting a Test-Driven Development (TDD) approach to build testable functions. As the deadline approached, we diligently pushed our branches and conducted comprehensive testing, ensuring the application's full functionality. In the end, we took pride in delivering a stable cost calculator tool.

									<h4>Now What? ? A Valuable Lesson</h4>
									<P>
										The hands-on experiences, collaborative discussions with team members, and the practical application of tools like COCOMO and Pytest added a tangible dimension to the theoretical knowledge imparted during the unit. As the journey through the module progresses, the reflective insights gained during this unit will serve as a compass, guiding the application of learned principles and practices in real-world scenarios. The emphasis on adaptability, collaboration, and a commitment to quality management positions aspiring software project managers for success in the dynamic and challenging landscape of software development. Overall, I feel like this module specifically has enhanced my practical skills as project managers and provided a detailed overview of software development metrics.
