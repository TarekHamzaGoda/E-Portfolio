									<h3>Learning Outcomes: Introduction to Software Engineering Project Management. </h3>
									<p>Unit 1 introduces software development strategies such as waterfall and agile approaches. Both methodologies are different in terms of application in which the development workflow is unique. 
									The first week of this module offered an introduction on software project management principles. This includes the necessities to understand the software development life cycle including the management of all parties involved with a project. This unit also introduces a schematic approach for software managers that underlines the planning, business, and IT activities as well as the common causes of project failures. Furthermore, I was excited to meet the team members for the first time this week in order to plan for the module’s upcoming assignments. Reflecting on my past experience with working within a collaborative environment, I have high hopes the valuable learning experience yet to come.
									</p>
									<h3>Team Notes: week 1</h3>
									<p>Following my introduction to the team members, we have agreed to create several SLACK channels to communicate our progress, these channels correspond to assignment 6 requirements. We have gathered some information from the transcript provided in unit 6 and have divided the tasks among ourselves. Brad will begin working on the project schedule, meanwhile Michle and Harris will look into gherkin statements and project risks. That’s said, I will be creating the project template with the key sections and begin looking at hardware and software requirements. We all agreed that the Agile methodology will be the main development framework for this project. Finally, we decided to schedule a weekly meeting on Mondays to communicate our progression through assignment tasks. Our team contract was concluded and submitted to the tutor. 
									</p>
								
									<h3>Discussion 1: Causes Of Project failures</h3>
									<p>
										According to (Lehtinen, et al., 2013) the common cause of project failure is derived from the following categories:  
									</p>
									<li>
										1.	People: Factors related to inexperience. 
									</li>
									<li>
										2.	Tasks: Factors related to task complexity and output.
									</li>
									<li>
										3.	Methods: Factors related to project processes and monitoring 
									</li>
									<li>
										4.	Environment: Factor related to resources, and schedules.
									</li>
									<br>

									<p>
										Furthermore, I believe that the three most common cause of project failure are the following: 
									</p>
									<br>
									<li>
										<b>Inadequate Planning and Scope Management:</b>
Undefined objectives can lead to confusion and constant change in requirements. As a result, an Inaccurate resource estimation may occur which increases the risks of budget overruns and missed deadlines. 
									</li>
									<li>
										<b>Ineffective Collaboration and Communication:</b>
Communication breakdowns between stakeholders, team members, and management can result in conflicts. The lack of clear communication can affect decision making and will lead to redundancy, reduced productivity and wasted efforts. 
									</li>
									<li>
										<b>Poor Risk Management:</b>
Failing to assess and identify potential risks at the beginning phases of the project can lead to unexpected delays. This will neglect to develop a mitigation plan that may result in risk escalations and serious issues. Moreover, ignoring external factors such as advancements in technology and changes in market needs can leave the project subject to disruptions. 
									</li>
									<br>
									<p>
										Below are examples of project failures as result of the causes mentioned above:
									</p>
									<br>
									<li>
										<b>Healthcare.gov (2013). A platform for health insurance plans.</b>
The platformed suffered from slow loading times, frequent crashes and incorrect data processing. this came as a result of inadequate planning considering that the project had an ambitious scope within a tight deadline (Anthopoulos, et al., 2016).  
									</li>
									<li>
										<b>UK National Programme for IT:</b>
An initiative to digitize the healthcare IT system in the UK. Due to the scope expanding over time and the increase of the project complexity created difficulties in managing the requirements leading to budget overrun that eventually resulted in a financial strain (Justinia, 2016).

									<h2>Unit 2</h2>
									</header>
									<h3>Learning Outcomes: Project Managment principles </h3>
									<p>
										In my view, the central focus of this unit revolved around estimation techniques, cost classifications, and gauging productivity as a software project manager. While similar principles apply across various project management domains, it was particularly crucial to grasp the metrics used to account for a programmer's contributions in the overall cost.
Moreover, the Unit 2 seminar on Estimation and Risk emphasized the importance of estimating programming efforts based on functionality rather than solely relying on Lines of Code (LOC). During this unit, my teammates and I began the process of preparing estimates for the hardware and software components required for Assignment One, utilizing a spreadsheet format keeping in mind strategies learned throughout this unit.   
									</p>
									<h3>Team Notes: Week 2</h3>
									<p> 
										In this week’s meeting, Brad and Michael developed a project plan with 6-week cycles and frequent local progress reviews. They considered scrum team compositions based on budget constraints. Michael created Gherkin statements for requirements, emphasizing the challenge of describing hardware specifications. They highlighted the importance of justifying decisions with references and discussed the possibility of creating different versions of the system. The team acknowledged the need to identify specific tasks for project lifecycle and discussed risk mitigations, TOGAF as an enterprise architecture, and the potential for profit by building more than 2000 machines. Moreover, I continued to allocate the appropriate HW and SW requirements using a spreadsheet to calculate the costs of each component. 
									</p>

									<header class="major">
									<h2>Unit 3</h2>
									</header>
									<h3>Learning Outcomes: Cost Estitmation Methods </h3>
									<p>
										This unit’s main take points in my opinion are the cost estimation techniques and planning strategies. This serves as a vital step for constructing the foundations for the developing a project. I had the opportunity to delve deeper into understanding the different types of cost estimation methods such as COCOMO and Expert Judgment.  I would like to discuss with my team members the possibility of using these techniques to assist us in building a constructive cost analysis for our system requirements during the assignments. 
									</p>
									<h3>Team Notes: Week 3</h3>
									<p>
										In this meeting, Brad presented a summary of the workers' plan, estimating it at around £185K, while Michael and I outlined their findings on hardware configuration, estimating costs at approximately £370K. Brad then summarized the project schedule, detailing eight 6-week cycles split into design, development, and testing weeks. Haaris suggested the possibility of generating revenue through alpha versions to aid in covering project costs, addressing budget concerns. The team discussed the cost of one machine, agreed on Gherkin statements, project plan template, and methodology sections, and explored the potential for system upgradability and extensibility. They operated under the assumption that EDC doesn't expect all 2000 systems simultaneously. Michael committed to working on other system variations, myself to adding information to the document and working on the introduction, Brad to initiating the limitations section and contributing to the timeline, and Haaris to focusing on the risk plan section. 
									</p>
									<h3>E-Portfolio Activity: Data Structures </h3>
									<p>
										Drawing from the insights presented in Dicheva & Hodge's (2018) paper on Data Structures, particularly focusing on stacks, it is evident that a multitude of online applications rely on this data structure. Social media platforms, for instance, leverage such data structures for various functions, including the storage of posts and images in the form of arrays and matrices. For instance, when users engage in activities like post editing, involving multiple actions, the system maintains a record of these changes in case the user decides to undo them. In such instances, the user can simply "pop" the latest change from the stack.

									<h2>Unit 4</h2>
									</header>
									<h3>Learning Outcomes: Risk Frameworks, Testing, and Cost estimation</h3>
									<p>
										During this unit, I had the chance to learn more about risk frameworks, test driven development and cost estimation methods. In particular, I was mostly drawn to test driven development process presented in seminar two that illustrated the development of test cases even before writing the main code. I am planning to utilize these phases of testing that includes Unit tests and integration tests in the future deliverables of the cost calculation application. 
									</p>
									<h3>Team Notes: Week 4</h3>
									<p>
										In this week’s meeting, we focused on the progress and cost analysis of their project. They discussed Michael's work on creating a cost-effective system for public sale, deliberating on pricing strategies and potential profitability. The team debated unit prices, manufacturing costs, and the financial feasibility of producing a certain device, exploring various options for selling the machines to the public. They also considered system simplification, budget reviews, and risk management strategies.

									<h3>Dicussion Summery: Causes Of Project failures</h3>
									<p>
										The discussion explores common causes of project failure, categorized by (Lehtinen et al.) as People, Tasks, Methods, and Environment. Three primary causes are emphasized: inadequate planning and scope management, ineffective collaboration and communication, and poor risk management. The Healthcare.gov example illustrates the real-world impact of these issues. The reply builds upon these causes, suggesting practical solutions such as iterative planning, collaboration tools, and risk assessment techniques. Agile methodologies are recommended for their adaptability. The importance of flexibility in the face of external factors is stressed. Overall, the dialogue provides insights into project failure, actionable recommendations, and the role of Agile in project success.
Discussion feedback provides an acknowledgment and reinforcement of the categorization of project failure causes. The expansion on each point includes practical suggestions for improvement. For inadequate planning and scope management, iterative planning methods like rolling wave planning are recommended. In the context of ineffective collaboration and communication, tools like JIRA or Asana and regular retrospectives are suggested. Concerning poor risk management, continuous risk assessment techniques such as the Delphi method and Monte Carlo simulations are proposed.

Furthermore, Dr. Oliver’s mention of Agile methodologies as a potential solution to mitigate project failure. Agile, with its emphasis on customer collaboration, responding to change, and incremental delivery, could have addressed issues in both discussed examples. Finally, the importance of maintaining flexibility and adaptability in project management, especially in the face of external factors like technological advancements and market changes, is highlighted.

Overall, the discussion and reply provide a comprehensive view of project failure causes, practical suggestions for improvement, and the role of Agile methodologies in addressing project challenges.

									<h2>Unit 5</h2>
									</header>
									<h3>Learning Outcomes: User Experiance </h3>
									<p>
										This unit cantered on establishing the groundwork for user experience, emphasizing the critical role of aligning with market expectations in the initial project stages for achieving a high-quality user experience. It introduced various UX metrics and methodologies, including Persona building, Journey mapping, and Polaristic Walkthrough. Additionally, the unit's lecture case shed light on yet another aspect of software project management which are the responsibilities of a project manager. After gaining insights into the stages a project manager navigates, such as project planning, governance, and communication plans, provides valuable knowledge that can aid me in effectively organizing project requirements.
									</p>
									<h3>Team Notes: Week 5</h3>
									<p>
										In this week’s meeting, the team extensively reviewed and adjusted their project report, personnel allocation, and machine production plans. Discussions included considerations for project scheduling, risk plans, and adjustments in project planning to ensure they stay within budget. The meeting concluded with the identification of next steps, including the review of Michael's document, the creation of a detailed delivery plan by Tarek, and the finalization of cost calculations by Brad. The team emphasized the need for accurate cost assessments and agreed to continue refining their work to meet project deadlines.
									</P>
									<h3>Unit 5 Discussion: Factors Affecting User Experience</h3>
									<p>
										Figure 1 in Minge & Thuring (2018) paper illustrates a CUE model that indicates the emotional reactions based on user perception of a system. In particular, the CUE model seems to highlight the initial user interactions by mainly capturing it’s influence by the usability and visual aesthetics. However, the full adaptation of this model might be redundant considering that this approach might not contribute to long term user satisfaction and loyalty. 
									</p>
									<P>
										A UX framework that takes into account the evolving nature of user experiences over time might be crucial for creating a user-centric product. According to (Karapanos, et al., 2011), few strategies can be implemented that can incorporate the dynamics of user emotions into a UX framework:
									</P>
									<P>
										<li>
											<b>User Research:</b>Conducting comprehensive research to understand the target audience, hence mapping the emotional response through different stages of the interaction with the product. This includes finding information on the user’s motivations and expectations when interacting with the system.
										</li>
										<li>
											<b>User Journey:</b>Development of detailed user journey maps that illustrates the emotional states users will encounter during their first use and those that become more experienced.
										</li>
										<li>
											<b>User onboarding:</b>Ensuring that the user’s expectations are managed and that the user is guided through the features of the system at the first glance. In addition, ensuring that the interface is user-friendly to avoid potential frustration and confusion.
										</li>
										<li>
											<b>Personalization:</b>Personalized features tailored based individual preferences ensure controlled emotional response.
										</li>
									</P>
									<P>
										By integrating these strategies into the UX framework, you can create a more adaptable and user-centered design that accommodates the changing emotional landscape of users from their initial interaction to becoming more experienced with the product.

									<h2>Unit 6</h2>
									</header>
									<h3>Learthing Outcomes: Pytest</h3>
									<p>
										In this unit, I got the chance to try another form of testing strategies using Python’s library Pytest. I feel that overall, pytest simplifies the testing process in Python, offering a robust and feature-rich framework that contributes to efficient and effective test development. I think that pytest offers concise and east to read syntax as well as a variety of assertions and exception handling. In general I find that pytest’s modularity supports the development of reusable code.  
									</p>
									<h3>Team Notes: week 6</h3>
									<p>
										This week’s meeting concludes the deliverables for part one of the assignments. We conducted a workshop to review the deliverable and ensure that the requirements are met in terms of budget, system components and selling plans. All of us went through the report as well as the cost estimation spreadsheet and Gant charts on last time before submission. We have decided that will discuss the deliverables of part of the assignment in the next meeting.

									<h2>Unit 7</h2>
									</header>
									<h3>Learing Outcomes: SW Devolopment Life Cycle (SDLC) </h3>
									<p>
										This week’s unit explored different types and stages of software development cycles. among are two types, Adaptive and Predictive. I was dazzled by the many types of adaptive development models; however, I understood that each type responded to a particular situation. TDD for instance, relies on the requirements being converted to test cases even before the software is fully developed. Another example is, Feature- driven developments which relies on the requirements as the main system components. Moreover, I was pleased to further my knowledge on the stages of SDLC as it structures the responsibilities of a project manager.  	
									</p>
									<h3>Team Notes: week 7</h3>
									<p>
										During this meeting, we discussed the deliverables that include a Python app designed for costing the application, a 20-minute slideshow comprising 10 slides covering EDC's complaints and their resolutions, an updated requirements table with justifications for the modified systems, and a document outlining project milestones, plans, sprints, project status, and a budget for the final implementation. There where Key questions to be addressed involve clarifying whether to use the shipping spec as a baseline or the team's proposed plan from submission 1, opting for their system over Syns Specification with a 13-month timeline and a budget of GBP 500,000, and ensuring clarity in assumptions for accurate evaluation by the professor. The team prioritizes focusing on the presentation, and they seek a professor meeting time request after 5 pm BST on any day. 
									</p>
									<h3>Dicussion Summery: Factors Affecting User Experience</h3>
									<p>
										Managing user reactions from a software and UX perspective and as a Software Project Manager mainly involves addressing user functionality and interface design. According to Mahlke and Thuring (2007) acceptance model for user experience, technology acceptance was determined by variables such as perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use. Additionally, characteristics such as terminology, navigation and screen design played a critical role in the over satisfaction of users. Managing user reactions in this case involves a combination of proactive strategies, continuous improvement, and effective communication. Shengli Deng and Yuling Fang (2015) Provides a guide that can assist in managing user emotional experience:
									</p>
									<p>
										<li>
											Establishing a Communication Channel: Ensures the accessibility to user feedback and concerns. This can be implemented by providing user-friendly support systems, encouraging user to share feedback on their experience through surveys and forums. 
										</li>
										<li>
											Active Listing & Feedback Analysis: Listening to user concerns while analysing and identifying patterns and common issues. Implementation includes conducting regular reviews of user feedback and tracking user behaviour (Christian & Malone , 2009). </li>
										<li>
											Regular Updates & Continuous Improvements: Keeping user informed of new features, improvements and bug fixes. This can be implemented by highlighting user feedback influence and prioritizing user feedback in development sprints. </li>
										<li>
											Setting Realistic Expectations: User expectations about software limitations and capabilities should be manged by clearly communicating scope, realistic timelines and feature implementations.  </li>
									</p>
									<p>
										User emotional reactions play a significant role in the success of any software product. As such, project managers must take into account these guidelines to ensure the maximum success of any UX development especially when it comes to functionality and interface design. Therefore, the effects of user emotional reactions can be determined in these areas (Hartson & Pyla , n.d.): 
									</p>
									<P>
										<li>
											User Engagement and Satisfaction: While users that have positive reaction towards a software tend to engage actively and perceive it as valuable, Negative reactions can lead to negative reviews and in extreme cases, abandonment. 
										</li>
										<li>
											Brand Perception: Users associate a positive experience with the brand as a whole. However, frustration resulting from negative experience can result in overall brand dissatisfaction that can affect the trust and loyalty. 
										</li>
									</P>
									<p>
										In conclusion. addressing user functionality and interface design with a focus on eliciting positive emotional reactions is crucial for the overall success and sustainability of a software product. As a project Manager, implementing these strategies can actively control user emotions.

									<h3>Assignment 1 Part Two Team Updates</h3>
									<p>
										In this week’s meeting we discussed tasks that will be handled by each team member. We agreed that Harris and Bard will create the presentation silds including the modifications on the system requirements and delivery plan. My self and Michle will be creating the python application including the GUI and cost calculation algorithm. We created a GIT Repo with branches for each team member.

									<h2>Unit 9</h2>
									</header>
									<h3>Learing Outcomes: Quality Management </h3>
									<p>
										During this unit, another aspect of project management principle is introduced. Quality management in my opinion, is one of the most critical aspects that needs to be taken into account during the development phase. Due to the constrains of budget, time, and scope, project quality can be greatly affected by these attributes. The unit sheds the light on the metrics and standards that ensure the level of quality is maintained during the development of the project. Some area where quality metrics take place include Functionality, Usability and Mentality. Hence, I am encouraged to allocate great effort to enforce quality management process. 
									</p>
									<h3>Team Notes: Week 9</h3>
									<p>
										During this week we conducted a series of meeting that took a form of workshops in order to fix errors with Tkniter GUI builder as well as the calculation algorithms. We also discussed the possibility of adding a CLI as an added feature to navigate the cost estimation application. This servers as a plan B in case the GUI did not function properly. Additionally, we discussed the delivery plans of the systems to EDC as our costs for producing the systems meet the budget even after addressing EDC’s concerns. 
									</p>
									<h3>E-Portfolio Activity: Scope Creep</h3>
									<p>
										Scope creep is the gradual expansion of modification of a project’s initial objectives without the any approval. This occurs when new functionalities are added without any corresponding increase in time constraints, budget or resources. Eventually, scope creeping can lead to project delays, cost overruns. 
									</p>
									<p><b>What aspects of a project are dependent on scope creep? </b></p>
									<p>
										<li>
											Timeline: changes in objectives can lead to delays and extended timeline 
										</li>
										<li>
											Budget: Increased resource requirement leading to budget overruns 
										</li>
										<li>
											Quality: Rushed implementation as result of scope creeping can compromise the overall quality
										</li>
									</p>
									<p><b>How to balance the competing requirements when scope creep occurs? </b></p>
									<p>There are several strategies to for balancing requirements during scope creep that includes:</p>
									<p>
										<li>
											Prioritization: Defining most critical features that meets project objectives
										</li>
										<li>
											Impact Assessment: Evaluate the impact of proposed changes on timeline and budget.
										</li>
										<li>
											Trade-offs: Identify area where new feature can replace agreed features. 
										</li>
									</p>
									<p><b>How do you stop scope creep?</b></p>

									<p>
										<li>
											Comprehensive Planning: Invest time in thorough project planning. Clearly define project objectives, requirements, and deliverables upfront.
										</li>
										<li>
											Regular Monitoring: Continuously monitor the project against the original plan. If deviations occur, address them promptly and involve stakeholders in decision-making.
										</li>
										<li>
											Educate Stakeholders: Ensure that all stakeholders understand the potential consequences of scope changes, including impacts on timeline, budget, and project quality.
										</li>
									</p>

									<h3>E-Portfolio Activity: Software Quality Factors</h3>
									<p>
										Software quality factors has evolved significantly since the 1970’s as a result of newer considerations and technological developments. This contributed significantly to the software development standards in many areas. In an article by (Lee, 2014) that discusses current software quality metrics, several factors are compared against McCall’s paper (McCall et al., 1977) during the 1970’s: 
									</p>
									<p><b>Complexity and Scale:</b></p>
										<li>
											1970s: Software projects were often smaller in scale and less complex. The systems developed were typically standalone applications, and the development processes were less formalized.
										</li>
										<li>
											1970s: Software projects were often smaller in scale and less complex. The systems developed were typically standalone applications, and the development processes were less formalized.
										</li>
									
									<p><b>Development Methodologies:</b></p>
										<li>
											1970s: Waterfall model and other traditional, linear methodologies were commonly used. Development was often a sequential process with little room for iteration.
										</li>
										<li>
											Today: Agile methodologies, DevOps, and continuous integration are widespread. Iterative and incremental development processes allow for more flexibility, adaptability to changing requirements, and continuous improvement.
										</li>
									<p><b>3.	Security:</b></p>
										<li>
											1970s: Security concerns were less prominent, and there was a limited awareness of potential vulnerabilities. Security measures were often an afterthought.
										</li>
										<li>
											Today: Security is a top priority. Software development practices include security considerations from the early stages, and there is a focus on implementing best practices to protect against cyber threats and vulnerabilities.
										</li>
									<p><b>Availability and Reliability:</b></p>
										<li>
											1970s: System availability and reliability were important but were sometimes compromised due to hardware limitations and less robust software design.
										</li>
										<li>
											Today: High availability and reliability are critical, especially in mission-critical systems and cloud-based applications. Redundancy, fault tolerance, and disaster recovery planning are common practices.
