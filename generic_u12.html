									<p>Object oriented Programming OOP was a fairly new concept to me. Although I was aware of the topic and understand that OOP is a programming method, getting exposed to the actual practice was a game changer. That is because I have always viewed myself 
                                        as someone who is more interested in Data Analysis rather than software engineering. Thus, I was mainly exposed to related languages such as R, Python, and MySQL where OOP is rarely practiced. However, Understanding the development process in OOP has increased my knowledge in system design, python scripting, and has changed my own methodology of achieving certain tasks. 
                                        On the other hand, being encouraged to record and observe my OOP practices on an e-portfolio has helped me understand software implementation processes from systems design all the way to code execution.   
                                    </p>
                                    <p>I have always thought that building a software requires intensive planning and analysis beforehand. However, I have lacked the appropriate tools to showcase system features. Therefore, I am glad to have learned the planning practices and requirement analysis using UMLs. In general, I think OOP practices in software development cycle can be summarized in the following:</p>
                                    <h3>A. UMLs and Main System Design</h3>
                                    <p>Planning how users interact with system in my opinion plays an integral part of system design. Objects are perceived as real-world interactions and functions. Therefore, OOP allows to break the program downs into sizable portions in order to understand object implementation (Annulata 2022). This can be seen in various types of UML views where each view represents an aspect of the system. Being able to build several models that are required for the driverless car system, I was able to understand the objective of each model. For instance, use case diagrams helped me acknowledge various components of autonomous cars such as the control unit and how it interacts with other components. Class diagrams are another example of UML that helped me understand and plan the classes, class attributes and methods that I needed to implement on the system. Heavily derived from the use case diagrams, class diagrams present main classes and sub classes and how they relate to each other. I was inclined to learn how objects represent each class and how each class represent a system component. Nevertheless, other UML designs such as State machine view and sequence diagrams are also vital elements of system design focusing on even smaller aspects of implementation. Overall, the ability to plan the software Implementation is a valuable asset towards better functionality. </p>
                                    <h3>B. Technical Implementation Of the software</h3>
                                    <p>Influenced by my previous codding practices, I was heavily depended on building standard code structures that are based on defining functions. I was also reliant on external libraires and built-in methods that achieved only what is required.  Luckily, OOP is the opposite of that. OOP encourages code reusability and flexibility. This can be reflected on the use of abstract class and methods. Building abstract classes provides a blueprint and a base component for every feature. Although it was a major challenge to understand in the beginning, being able to test and debug the code multiple times while building the driverless car system has assisted my learning process. At the start, I was facing several difficulties trying to understand class inheritance and polymorphism and how different instance of objects can be deployed by the user. Another aspect of this that I personally though was challenging to implement is the different types of data structures. While I had basic understanding of different data types and how classes can store data as a class attributes, trying to retrieve and update data between classes was often met with frustration. One of the main features of the autonomous car system is the ability to store traffic sign types, detected objects and the user’s ability to view the car log. After countless hours of practicing and testing the system, I was able to use data retrieval or getter functions such as keys()/update() within a dedicated class method for updating and recording the car database. Not only that, but also calculate time stamps and have them recorded in the database. </p>
                                    <h3>C. Testing, Documentation and Validation </h3>
                                    <p>I was always tempted to ignore testing code components until a specific system feature is completed. This resulted in many failed attempts to ensure the functionality of the code. However, having a test case strategy as well as applying functional and unit tests has increased my efficiency during system implementation. Unit testing for instance, all possible configuration and states are tested ( Barrientos 2014). As an example, During the implementation of the driverless car, various tests were attempted to verify the detection of objects such as road obstacles. The test case explores wither the car will change lanes when inserting an obstacle. This includes the insertion of an obstacle as a temporary object that contain lane position. As a result, the car lane will change. Similar test as such, has proven time-efficient as I progress through the code.

                                        In conclusion, I have discovered that although UML design is considered a vital aspect of the initial phases of software development. However, I also think that Planning and implementation can be achieved simultaneously. This allows for:
                                    </p>
                                    <ol>
                                        <li>Detailed planning: Including more detailed class diagrams, attributes and methods. Detailed Diagrams of class objects temporary and permanent. </li>
                                        <li>Code Functionality assurance: With the aid of automated unit tests using “Pytest”.</li>
                                        <li>Reusability: Structural views or UML of base components to build abstract methods.</li>
                                        <li>Code Quality: OOM or object-oriented metrics is unit to measure code reusability (Chandra & Bhateja 2017). I think it is a valuable tool to be used in future system development to ensure code quality.</li>
                                    </ol>
                                    <p>Finally, I was able to identify areas in OOP where more practice is required. Some of which include data structure, access (getters and setters) and retrieval.  This module has also helped me understand the basic structure of software systems development.</p>
