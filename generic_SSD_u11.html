									<h3>The National Security Detection Portal Coding Output Evaluation </h3>
									<p>
										This week, the submission for the Cyber Concerns Tracking web app was due, the coding output can be viewed from the link below, as well as the design document.

									</P>
									<p>
										Overall, participating in this activity was fullfiliing, Although few challanges were meet during the luanch of the application, it is safe to say that the intended requirements from our design proposal is met.

                                    <h3>Learning Outcomes: Microservices </h3>
									<p>
										For this unit, software development architecture trends were introduced. I was enlightened to understand the key differences between monolithic structures and microservices. In contrast, I think the main differences between both architectures is rigidity of monolithic structures as opposed the modularity of the microservices. However, both approaches can have advantages and disadvantages based on the requirements. 
									</p>
									
									<h3>Team Notes: Week 11</h3>
									<p>
										We have finally able to deploy our website using Azure platform, we have also uploaded the updated package to a GitHub repo that is connected to the server. We had a couple of issue with loading some of the webpages after lunching the webapp although everything was working fine on the local version. As we are a couple of hours away from the deadline, we participated in a 5-hour long workshop to finalize the main.py file, provide the testing results, and readme files. Although few errors where left unresolved, we were content with we had built for the time being. We believe that the main application requirements have been meet and that it was such pleasure to work with my team during some challenging phases. 
									</p>
									<h3>Debate: Microservices & Microkernels</h3>
									<p>
										I believe that Microservices and microkernels are software architecture concepts that offer various benefits to the development cycle.
									</p>
									<p>
										First and foremost, the architecture allows for individual components to be developed independently in which it enables scalability. These components are reusable and are not redeveloped from scratch which cuts down the development time. Microservices also allows for flexibility and agility in which each component can be deployed and tested without impacting other parts of the software. Furthermore, Microservices approach is resilient as its dose not necessarily bring down the entire system if a specific function fails. As a result, this can enable scalable approaches in which functional teams can be responsible of individual microservices allowing for effective and innovative decision making. Finally, Microservices architecture allows for the use of different technologies and programming languages for different microservices, based on their specific requirements. This enables organizations to choose the best tools and technologies for each microservice, which can result in improved performance and efficiency.
									</p>
									<p>
										Overall, I think the modular approach of microservices and microkernel can be presented as a secure and reliable software development technique that insures the delivery of the requirements in an effective manner.
