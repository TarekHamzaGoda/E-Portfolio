									<h2>Unit 1</h2>
									</header>
									<h3>Learning Outcomes: An intorduction to risk management</h3>
									<p>Having learned the basic fundamentals in secure software development, I became increasingly eager to explore into what could be considered the broader perspective: Risk Management. 
									In this unit, various information security management concepts are introduced, providing awareness on different facets of the term "threat." Moreover, Unit 1 offers a comprehensive overview of risk assessment frameworks and mitigation strategies, which I think is essential in the journey toward developing a secure system. In summary, a risk management system consists of Risk Identification, assessment, and Reduction.  I was also fond of learning about the key drivers of industry 4.0 and researching several organizations that under go the digitization process with such risk in consideration. 
									</p>
									<h3>Discussion 1: The Risks of digitization</h3>
									<p>
										Industry 4.0 suggests a subsequent phase of evolution within the production and manufacturing process. This progression is particularly characterized by the essential role of technologies such as advanced robotics, artificial intelligence, and big data. Collectively, these technologies serve as the main driver of this digitization process (Kovaite & Stankevičienė 2019). However, Kovaitė and Stankevičienė (2019) argue that rapid digitalization in new business models provides a considerable array of risks including the lack of a structured framework to identify these risks. Nonetheless, Kovaite & Stankevičienė present a categorized list of potential risks among those, two prominent categories with their instances:   
									</p>
									<p>
									<li>
										Technical Risks: Highlighted in research by Goswami & Schuurmans (2022), HIROTEC, an automotive manufacturing partner, runs the risk of prolonged operational downtime as they monitor the newly implemented IoT to run a “preventive maintenance” regimen. “If it takes a 3-minute phone call to report an issue, you’ve lost $70,000 just telling someone you have a problem.” Goswami & Schuurmans, (2022 : 77)
									</li>
									<li>
										Financial Risks: Furthermore, the research underlines another instance of financial risk. Al Rumman Parama, a prominent pharmaceutical provider within the MENA, aspires to link the gap between demand and supply. After implementing a new procurement system, AL Rumman Pharma is exposed to a potential reduction of valuable resources in training and adaptation (Goswami & Schuurmans, 2022).
									</li>
									</p>
									<p>
										In accordance with Kovaitė and Stankevičienė (2019), Luo (2022) explores another type of risk known as Digital Regulatory complexity. This occurs as a result of different types of digitization regulations and standards imposed on enterprises. As such these practices performed by governments increase the potential of digital risks imposed on enterprises.

									<h3>Learning Outcomes: Introduction to Threat Modeling </h3>
									<p> 
										After learning about various risk assessment methodologies, including quantitative and qualitative approaches, and becoming familiar with esteemed risk certifying bodies like Open FAIR and Octave, Unit 2 goes in depth into the process of risk identification while emphasizing the fundamental principles of threat modelling.
										Initially, I found myself somewhat overwhelmed by the number of frameworks available for threat modeling. However, as I progressed through the module, I gained a more profound understanding of the relevance of specific threat models based on the scale of the business and the types of assets involved. Furthermore, the module introduced me to a range of cyber threats, encompassing incidental, malicious, and insider threats, along with associated prevention techniques.
										What particularly stood out to me was the scalability and clarity of models like STRIDE and Attack Trees, which I believe can be effectively implemented and presented to stakeholders.

									<h2>Unit 3</h2>
									</header>
									<h3>Learning Outcomes: Threat Modeling techniques </h3>
									<p>
										Unit 3 provides further practical experience on applying thread modelling techniques on a real-world scenario. This week’s main focus was on assignment 1 which requires us to evaluate an emerging pet store business and provide a risk assessment report of the store’s current business and future business model. I was delighted to get firsthand experience in combining the business’s objectives with the associated risks related to their dataflow. I found that both STRIDE and Octave frameworks supported in the ISO 31000 risk management system is the best approach for such a small business. I think that these models are highly scalable and share several similarities in terms of the current and future business strategies of Pampered Pets. In addition, the unit’s lecture cast provided in depth knowledge on the several threat modelling frameworks and metrics such as PASTA, TRIKE and Open Fair.
									</p>
									<h3>E-Portfolio Exercise: Security Standards</h3>
									<p>
										According to the mentioned security standards, few regulations might apply to Pampered Pets. For instance, GDPR primarily focus on personal data protection, as such Pampered Pets are held accountable for the customer emails database and any information obtained from online transactions after the business’s digitization process. In this case, several protocols from the GDPR might apply such as:
									</p>
									<p>
									<li>
										Consent for Data processing.
									</li>
									<li>
										Implementation of Security measures. 
									</li>
									<li>
										Reporting data breaches. 
									</li>
									</p>
									<p>
										Moreover, If Pampered Pets accepts credit card payments, whether in-store or online, they must adhere to PCI DSS. PCI DSS applies to any business that processes, stores, or transmits credit card data.
									</p>
									<p>
									<li>
										Maintaining a secure network infrastructure.									</li>
									<li>
										Protecting cardholder data with encryption.									</li>
									<li>
										Regularly monitoring and testing security systems.									</li>
									<li>
										Implementing access controls and security policies.		</li>							
									</p>
									<p>
										Although HIPAA might not apply Entirely, Pampered Pets sell products related to pet medications or medical records, in this case HIPAA considerations may come into play. Key HIPAA requirements that might apply include:
									</p>
									<p>
									<li>
										Safeguarding the privacy and security of PHI.			</li>						
									<li>
										Implementing administrative, physical, and technical safeguards to protect PHI.	</li>
									<li>
										Ensuring proper authorization and access controls for PHI.			</li>						
									<li>
										Reporting breaches of PHI to the relevant authorities and affected individuals.</li>
									</p>
									<p>
										Ensuring that GDPR, PCI DSS, and HIPAA standards are being met involves a combination of assessments, audits, and ongoing monitoring. Checking if the standards are met involves the following procedures. 									</p>
									<p>
									<li>
										Identifying and documenting all data flows within the organization.			</li>						
									<li>
										Ensure that employees are trained on GDPR compliance and aware of their responsibilities regarding personal data protection.	</li>
									<li>
										Regularly audit and monitor data processing activities and security measures to identify and rectify non-compliance issues.			</li>						
									<li>
										Conduct regular risk assessments to identify vulnerabilities and threats to protected health information (PHI)</li>
									<li>
										Consider engaging a third-party auditor to assess HIPAA compliance and provide recommendations.</li>
									</p>

									<h2>Unit 4</h2>
									</header>
									<h3>Learning Outcomes: Cybersecurity frameworks</h3>
									<p>
										This unit provides comprehensive insights into cybersecurity frameworks, their core components, and the methodologies for their implementation. My eager dive into the steps of establishing security frameworks like NIST and ISO 27001.
										As I previously wondered about the necessary steps to take in the event of a security breach, I finally discover that this unit introduces disaster recovery plans, offering clarity on critical concepts such as recovery time objectives (RTO) and recovery point objectives (RPO). Additionally, it introduced me to the concepts of hot, warm, and cold standbys, recommended backup sites, and tailored best practices aligned with an organization's unique needs.
									</p>

									<h3>Collaborative Wiki Development: Security Framworks</h3>

									<h3>Seminar Preparation: Disaster Recovery (DR)</h3>
									<p><b> Activity 1: DR Definitions </b></p>
									<p>
										Hot, Warm, and cold standby are approaches and strategies to disaster discovery. Each vary in levels associated with cost, Recovery Time Objective (RTO), Recovery Point Objective (RPO), and availability. The differences will be previewed in the table below. The choice between hot, warm, and cold standby strategies depends on an organization's requirements for availability, data loss tolerance.
									</p>
									<p>
										<span class="image main"><img src="images/ISMDR1.png" alt="" /></span>
									</p>
									
									<p>
										The technology applied plays a crucial role for creating a hot standby solution between two on-premise data centers. The choice depends on the infrastructure and network connectivity available based on the feasibility and effectiveness of the solution. Below are some factors to consider for Hot standby solutions:
									</p>
									<p>
										<li>
											Network Redundancy: high availability requires robust failover capabilities such as network links and switches to ensure seamless communication between data canters. 
										</li>
										<li>
											Load Balancing: Such solution requires the traffic from user to be distributed in order to maintain high availability. 
										</li>
										<li>
											Monitoring and Alerting: Comprehensive monitoring solutions can proactively detect issues in order to trigger necessary failover processes. 
										</li>
									</p>
									<p><b> Activity 2: DR Solutions Design </b></p>
									<p>Below are several main lock-down issues provided by the suggested authors:</p>
									<p>
										<li>
											Proprietary Services and APIs: Cloud provider often offer services and APIs unique to their platform. 
										</li>
										<li>
											Data Transfer Costs: Transferring data out of a cloud provider’s environment can endure expensive cost, therefore organizations deter from switching to an In0house solution or a different provider. 
										</li>
										<li>
											Lack of compatibility: Applications and workloads optimized for one cloud provider are not easily transferred to another provider due to difference in APIs and infrastructure. 
										</li>
										<li>
											Migration Costs: The process to migrate data and services from one cloud to another is time-consuming and costly. 
										</li>
									</p>
									<p>
										Additional, below are some mitigation strategies proposed for the above issues: 
									</p>
									<p>
										<li>
											Multi cloud strategy: Hybird cloud solution to reduce dependency on provider.
										</li>
										<li>
											Standardize on Open Standards: Choose technologies and APIs that adhere to open standards. This will allow the transition between other providers easier. 
										</li>
										<li>
											Data Portability: Apply data portability best practices, include open data formats and migration plan in place. Regular back up data and ensures its in a format that can be easily moved. 
										</li>
									</p>
									<p>
										Moreover, some of the security concerns related to cloud solutions along with possible mitigations include the following:
									</p>
									<p><u>Data Breaches: Unauthorized access to data stored leading to leaks. This can be mitigated through the following suggestions:</u></p>
									<p>
										<li>
											Implementing multi-factor authentication and strong access control
										</li>
										<li>
											Encrypt data at rest and in transit 
										</li>
										<li>
											Regular audit and monito access to sensitive data. 
										</li>
									</p>
									<p><u>Identity and Access Management: Management of user access and permissions can lead to unauthorised access or privilege escalation. This can be mitigated by:</u></p>
									<p>
										<li>
											Role-based access control 
										</li>
										<li>
											Regular update and review user access permissions
										</li>
									</p>
									<p><u>Data Loss and Availability: Cloud services outages or data loss incidents can impact business process. Mitigations:</u></p>
									<p>
										<li>
											Data backup and disaster recovery plans.
										</li>
