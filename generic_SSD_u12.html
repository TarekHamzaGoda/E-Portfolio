									<h3>Learning Outcomes: Future Trends</h3>
									<p>
										As a continuation of the pervious week’s topic on future trends and the differences between monolithic structure and microservices, according to____ the main differences lie in performance and security.  Microkernels are often considered more secure due to their modular and isolated design. A security breach in one component or module is less likely to affect other components or the core kernel. In monolithic structures, a vulnerability in one part of the kernel can potentially compromise the entire system. Monolithic structures can have better performance in certain scenarios, as system functionalities are tightly integrated into a single kernel, reducing the overhead of IPC and context switching. Microkernels, on the other hand, may have slightly higher overhead due to the need for IPC and context switching between components.
									</p>
									<p>
											
										This unit highlights the final week of this module. In my opinion, there was a lot to learn and I was particularly encouraged to work in a group for the first time during my MSC studies.  
									</p>
									<h3>Final Module Reflection</h3>

									<h4>What?</h4>
									<p>
										The software development realm contains many fronts in which I needed to understand. I had a background about several software design methodologies such as UML design, design patterns and object-oriented programming. However, I lacked the sufficient knowledge on how to develop a SECURE software. Moreover, I was even more concerned with my ability to provide sufficient and useful contribution as team a member. These reasons resembled as my main fear during this module and that I was hoping to overcome them.
									</p>
									<p>
										This module presented several topics that I though was the most challenging. These topics included concepts of software development such as Regex, Encryptions and Microservices. In addition to this, system testing was once again a significant part of this module. With some background on these concepts, I lacked the overall understating and practical experience. I was overwhelmed with the amount of information around methods and techniques of encryptions, secure design patterns, and cryptography with no idea on how to implement them. I began to develop more concerns on my ability to understand the development cycle and to contribute what I have learned with my team mates. 
									</p>
									<h4>So What?</h4>
									<p>
										As I progressed through the module, it became evident that I was beginning to grasp some of the concepts around secure software design. That came as a result of my participation during the creation of the web application design document. I thought to myself that I am facing my fears that initially grew at the start of this module and that I can approach this in step-by-step manner.  I have also discovered that I enjoy the organization of the required material into a structure that can be comprehended and distributed amongst my-self and the team members. That in my opinion, become beneficial after understand each team members abilities and interests. For instance, during one of our workshops, I have found the two of the team members are experienced with handling and launching databases into a deployment platform, and that another team member and my-self are more interested in handling the application’s interface and security aspects of it. This exercise promoted a smooth corporative experience that assisted us into compiling the software in an efficient manner. 
									</p>
									<p>
										Another aspect of this module that I found beneficial to my learning experience was the application of some of the pervious module topics such as Object-Oriented Programming, Design patterns and code testing. That is because during our implementation phase of the web portal, our tasks were divided according to the system features that we had to compile into on single structured file at the end of the module. That included a series of small sections that consists of functions for the log-in feature, a sign-up page and the database connection protocol. I have then proceeded to create classes for each feature that can be reusable through out the application. In addition, I was keen to apply some of the testing strategies using “unittest” module of python with system features we created. 
									</p>
									<p>
										Another great feature of this module was the series of topics that assisted us with the completion of the coding output. One of which I though was the most beneficial is regular expressions or regex. This came on handy during our search for an appropriate input validation technique to our sign-up portal of our web app (Dougherty & Kirk , 2009).. In addition, several topics that was rather complicated such as cryptography, encryption and Ontologies were also vital to our over contribution to the project. We have taken to our advantage python’s cryptography built-in library to encrypt the collected data traffic from web application before storing to the database. In my opinion, the availability of theses resource along side the development phase has assisted in understanding the methods needed to build our application. In addition, this module’s forum discussions have encouraged me into finding the right resources that was vital to my understanding of the secure software design principles. OWASP for instance, has provided a proper introduction to the common software vulnerabilities and preventions methods which in turn has helped us fortify our application against common threats. Additional topics including base69 encryption and microservices where particularly interesting to learn and has help expand my horizon on the software development realm and we proved beneficial for my learning curve. 
									</p>
					
									<h4>Now What?</h4>
									<P>
										The completion of this project was an important milestone for my-self as it was my first subject related instance as contributor in a team environment. Working with a framework such as flask and constructing the interface, client-server communications and securing the database was an eventful experience. Coordinating with my teammates and observing the website’s growth into a tangible product was highly fulfilling as well. Following this experience, I can start to see the areas where I require additional improvement and the subjects that enjoy the most. I think that secure software development should be a standard practice and that I plan to develop small scall applications or features to practice testing and encryption. Moreover, I would like to get more involved with creating secure database transactions and be up to date with the latest software design trends and practices. 
									</P>
									<P>
										Overall, I think that a lot was learned during this module, especially during the process of delivering my first application. I found that my most joyful experiences fall under working within a team-based environment and that putting together the application was extremely meaningful. It is safe to say that this module covers most of the software design aspects and methods that I was unaware of ranging from secure software practices, encryption and future trends.
