									<h2>Unit 1</h2>
									</header>
									<h3>Learning Outcomes: Introduction to Software Engineering Project Management. </h3>
									<p>Unit 1 introduces software development strategies such as waterfall and agile approaches. Both methodologies are different in terms of application in which the development workflow is unique. 
									The first week of this module offered an introduction on software project management principles. This includes the necessities to understand the software development life cycle including the management of all parties involved with a project. This unit also introduces a schematic approach for software managers that underlines the planning, business, and IT activities as well as the common causes of project failures. Furthermore, I was excited to meet the team members for the first time this week in order to plan for the module’s upcoming assignments. Reflecting on my past experience with working within a collaborative environment, I have high hopes the valuable learning experience yet to come.
									</p>
									<h3>Team Notes: week 1</h3>
									<p>Following my introduction to the team members, we have agreed to create several SLACK channels to communicate our progress, these channels correspond to the assignment 6 requirements. We have gathered some information from the transcript provided in unit 6 and have divided the tasks among ourselves. Brad will begin working on the project schedule, meanwhile Michle and Harris will look into gherkin statements and project risks. That’s said, I will be creating the project template with the key sections and begin looking at hardware and software requirements. We all agreed that the Agile methodology will be the main development framework for this project. Finally, we decided to schedule a weekly meeting on Mondays to communicate our progression through assignment tasks. Our team contract was concluded and submitted to the tutor. 
									</p>
								
									<h3>Discussion 1: Causes Of Project failures</h3>
									<p>
										According to (Lehtinen, et al., 2013) the common cause of project failure is derived from the following categories:  
									</p>
									<li>
										1.	People: Factors related to inexperience. 
									</li>
									<li>
										2.	Tasks: Factors related to task complexity and output.
									</li>
									<li>
										3.	Methods: Factors related to project processes and monitoring 
									</li>
									<li>
										4.	Environment: Factor related to resources, and schedules.
									</li>
									<br>

									<p>
										Furthermore, I believe that the three most common cause of project failure are the following: 
									</p>
									<br>
									<li>
										<b>Inadequate Planning and Scope Management:</b>
Undefined objectives can lead to confusion and constant change in requirements. As a result, an Inaccurate resource estimation may occur which increases the risks of budget overruns and missed deadlines. 
									</li>
									<li>
										<b>Ineffective Collaboration and Communication:</b>
Communication breakdowns between stakeholders, team members, and management can result in conflicts. The lack of clear communication can affect decision making and will lead to redundancy, reduced productivity and wasted efforts. 
									</li>
									<li>
										<b>Poor Risk Management:</b>
Failing to assess and identify potential risks at the beginning phases of the project can lead to unexpected delays. This will neglect to develop a mitigation plan that may result in risk escalations and serious issues. Moreover, ignoring external factors such as advancements in technology and changes in market needs can leave the project subject to disruptions. 
									</li>
									<br>
									<p>
										Below are examples of project failures as result of the causes mentioned above:
									</p>
									<br>
									<li>
										<b>Healthcare.gov (2013). A platform for health insurance plans.</b>
The platformed suffered from slow loading times, frequent crashes and incorrect data processing. this came as a result of inadequate planning considering that the project had an ambitious scope within a tight deadline (Anthopoulos, et al., 2016).  
									</li>
									<li>
										<b>UK National Programme for IT:</b>
An initiative to digitize the healthcare IT system in the UK. Due to the scope expanding over time and the increase of the project complexity created difficulties in managing the requirements leading to budget overrun that eventually resulted in a financial strain (Justinia, 2016).

									<h2>Unit 2</h2>
									</header>
									<h3>Learning Outcomes: Project Managment principles </h3>
									<p>
										In my view, the central focus of this unit revolved around estimation techniques, cost classifications, and gauging productivity as a software project manager. While similar principles apply across various project management domains, it was particularly crucial to grasp the metrics used to account for a programmer's contributions in the overall cost.
Moreover, the Unit 2 seminar on Estimation and Risk emphasized the importance of estimating programming efforts based on functionality rather than solely relying on Lines of Code (LOC). During this unit, my teammates and I began the process of preparing estimates for the hardware and software components required for Assignment One, utilizing a spreadsheet format keeping in mind strategies learned throughout this unit.   
									</p>
									<h3>Team Notes: Week 2</h3>
									<p> 
										In this week’s meeting, Brad and Michael developed a project plan with 6-week cycles and frequent local progress reviews. They considered scrum team compositions based on budget constraints. Michael created Gherkin statements for requirements, emphasizing the challenge of describing hardware specifications. They highlighted the importance of justifying decisions with references and discussed the possibility of creating different versions of the system. The team acknowledged the need to identify specific tasks for project lifecycle and discussed risk mitigations, TOGAF as an enterprise architecture, and the potential for profit by building more than 2000 machines. Moreover, I continued to allocate the appropriate HW and SW requirements using a spreadsheet to calculate the costs of each component. 
									</p>

									<header class="major">
									<h2>Unit 3</h2>
									</header>
									<h3>Learning Outcomes: Cost Estitmation Methods </h3>
									<p>
										This unit’s main take points in my opinion are the cost estimation techniques and planning strategies. This serves as a vital step for constructing the foundations for the developing a project. I had the opportunity to delve deeper in understanding the different types of cost estimation methods such as COCOMO and Expert Judgment.  I would like to discuss the possibility of using these techniques in the future to asset as in building a constructive cost analysis for our system requirements during the assignments.  
									</p>
									<h3>Team Notes: Week 3</h3>
									<p>
										In this meeting, Brad presented a summary of the workers' plan, estimating it at around £185K, while Michael and I outlined their findings on hardware configuration, estimating costs at approximately £370K. Brad then summarized the project schedule, detailing eight 6-week cycles split into design, development, and testing weeks. Haaris suggested the possibility of generating revenue through alpha versions to aid in covering project costs, addressing budget concerns. The team discussed the cost of one machine, agreed on Gherkin statements, project plan template, and methodology sections, and explored the potential for system upgradability and extensibility. They operated under the assumption that EDC doesn't expect all 2000 systems simultaneously. Michael committed to working on other system variations, myself to adding information to the document and working on the introduction, Brad to initiating the limitations section and contributing to the timeline, and Haaris to focusing on the risk plan section.

									<h3>E-Portfolio Activity: </h3>
									<p>
										Drawing from the insights presented in Dicheva & Hodge's (2018) paper on Data Structures, particularly focusing on stacks, it is evident that a multitude of online applications rely on this data structure. Social media platforms, for instance, leverage such data structures for various functions, including the storage of posts and images in the form of arrays and matrices. For instance, when users engage in activities like post editing, involving multiple actions, the system maintains a record of these changes in case the user decides to undo them. In such instances, the user can simply "pop" the latest change from the stack.

									<h2>Unit 4</h2>
									</header>
									<h3>Learning Outcomes: Risk Frameworks, Testing, and Cost estimation</h3>
									<p>
										During this unit, I had the chance to learn more about risk frameworks, test driven development and cost estimation methods. In particular, I was mostly drawn to test driven development process presented in seminar two that illustrated the development of test cases even before writing the main code. I am planning to utilize these phases of testing that includes Unit tests and integration tests in the future deliverables of the cost calculation application. 
									</p>
									<h3>Team Notes: Week 4</h3>
									<p>
										In this week’s meeting, we focused on the progress and cost analysis of their project. They discussed Michael's work on creating a cost-effective system for public sale, deliberating on pricing strategies and potential profitability. The team debated unit prices, manufacturing costs, and the financial feasibility of producing a certain device, exploring various options for selling the machines to the public. They also considered system simplification, budget reviews, and risk management strategies.

									<h2>Unit 5</h2>
									</header>
									<h3>Learning Outcomes: User Experiance </h3>
									<p>
										This unit cantered on establishing the groundwork for user experience, emphasizing the critical role of aligning with market expectations in the initial project stages for achieving a high-quality user experience. It introduced various UX metrics and methodologies, including Persona building, Journey mapping, and Polaristic Walkthrough. Additionally, the unit's lecture case shed light on yet another aspect of software project management which are the responsibilities of a project manager. After gaining insights into the stages a project manager navigates, such as project planning, governance, and communication plans, provides valuable knowledge that can aid me in effectively organizing project requirements.
									</p>
									<h3>Team Notes: Week 5</h3>
									<p>
										In this week’s meeting, the team extensively reviewed and adjusted their project report, personnel allocation, and machine production plans. Discussions included considerations for project scheduling, risk plans, and adjustments in project planning to ensure they stay within budget. The meeting concluded with the identification of next steps, including the review of Michael's document, the creation of a detailed delivery plan by Tarek, and the finalization of cost calculations by Brad. The team emphasized the need for accurate cost assessments and agreed to continue refining their work to meet project deadlines.
									</P>
									<h3>Unit 5 Discussion: </h3>
									<p>
										Figure 1 in Minge & Thuring (2018) paper illustrates a CUE model that indicates the emotional reactions based on user perception of a system. In particular, the CUE model seems to highlight the initial user interactions by mainly capturing it’s influence by the usability and visual aesthetics. However, the full adaptation of this model might be redundant considering that this approach might not contribute to long term user satisfaction and loyalty. 
									</p>
									<P>
										A UX framework that takes into account the evolving nature of user experiences over time might be crucial for creating a user-centric product. According to (Karapanos, et al., 2011), few strategies can be implemented that can incorporate the dynamics of user emotions into a UX framework:
									</P>
									<P>
										<li>
											<b>User Research:</b>Conducting comprehensive research to understand the target audience, hence mapping the emotional response through different stages of the interaction with the product. This includes finding information on the user’s motivations and expectations when interacting with the system.
										</li>
										<li>
											<b>User Journey:</b>Development of detailed user journey maps that illustrates the emotional states users will encounter during their first use and those that become more experienced.
										</li>
										<li>
											<b>User onboarding:</b>Ensuring that the user’s expectations are managed and that the user is guided through the features of the system at the first glance. In addition, ensuring that the interface is user-friendly to avoid potential frustration and confusion.
										</li>
										<li>
											<b>Personalization:</b>Personalized features tailored based individual preferences ensure controlled emotional response.
										</li>
									</P>
									<P>
										By integrating these strategies into the UX framework, you can create a more adaptable and user-centered design that accommodates the changing emotional landscape of users from their initial interaction to becoming more experienced with the product.

									<h2>Unit 6</h2>
									</header>
									<h3>Learthing Outcomes: Testing libraries</h3>
									<p>
										This unit was somehow and extension of the testing and debugging topics of the previous unit. I have continued to experiment with python built in testing libraries and linters that improves my code quality and structure. Since this week was the due date of our design document for the cyber security application, we have began testing out log-in and sign-up features of our software using these strategies. 
									</p>
									<h3>Team Notes: week 6</h3>
									<p>
										This week was the due date for the design proposal. We conducted a series of workshops over the weekend beforehand to reorganize the structure of the design document. We previously planned that Richard and Charles will be in charge of the required database integration methods as well as the UML diagrams meanwhile Elise and myself prepared the secure software design tools and methodologies. Finally, we collectively proof read each other’s parts to ensure the clarity of the design proposal. We have also conducted several tests on the login and sign-up prototype which had the OTP integration and made sure that it followed the same logic as the UML diagrams that are presented. 
									</p>
									<h3>Portfolio Component: Codio exercise </h3>
									<p>
										The following code in stylelint.py file contained few errors that prevented it from running properly. In the view version, Indentation was added along with a print statement in order for the code be executed properly. 
									</p>
										
									<p>
										After running the flake8 module on the original code, the missing indentation error was returned in which the white spaces was viewed. In this case all the errors are viewed and amended.

									<h2>Unit 7</h2>
									</header>
									<h3>Learing Outcomes: Operating Systems</h3>
									<p>
										During this week, I explored the history and development of a typical operating systems and how an OS acts as the intermediary between computer hardware and software applications. It was also interesting to understand the common types of operating systems that are general-purposed and specific specialized environments. Furthermore, I have learned about the common measures to ensure the security of an operating system that includes limiting user preferences, use of strong authentication and monitoring the system. 	
									</p>
									<h3>Team Notes: week 7</h3>
									<p>
										This week’s meeting was challenging as we discussed the main framework where the web application would be built on. During our workshop we went through the blueprints for both Django and Flask. Since most of the team members were not familiar with Django framework, we have decided that Flask will the main farmwork as it is easy to understand and is prone to fewer errors and bugs. We have decided that I will be tasked with building the main interface, setting up the main HTML pages, CSS, Jscript as well as the client and server connections. Meanwhile Elsie will be responsible for creating the syntax for the log-in and sign-up module which will later be integrated with the main flask application. Richard and Charles will be tasked with building databases on MySQL and setting the connection protocol to the backend on my side. 
									</p>
									<h3>Portfolio Component: Ontology</h3>
									<p>
										In computer Science, Ontology is referred to as an explicit specification of an abstract model. According to (Gaitanou, 2009), an Ontology Web Service language for example, aims to provide a catalogue for the development phase or any type of implementation technology that can assist an organization with getting up to speed with the right technology. However, OWS is an Ontology that is specific for the web domain. In other words, an Ontology of web services for instance, can be described as a formal knowledge or a set of concepts that provides the building blocks of Semantic Web Technology. 
									</p>
									<p>
										An example ontology relevant to this module’s Vulnerabilities Tracking Web App is provided below. 
									</p>
									<span class="image main"><img src="images/o11.png" alt="" /></span>
									<h3>Artefacts: CLI With Python</h3>
									<p>
										A command shell that implements the following commands will be created with python. Please review the code here.
										<a href="https://github.com/TarekHamzaGoda/04_Module_4_SSD_Jan23/blob/main/01_Activities/u7_cli.py">source code</a>.</p>
									</p>
									<p>
										<li>
											“LIST” : lists all the files in the same directory. 
										</li>
										<li>
											“ADD” : adds two digits.
										</li>
										<li>
											“HELP”: preview all commands.
										</li>
										<li>
											“EXIT” : Exits the command shell.

									<h2>Unit 8</h2>
									</header>
									<h3>Learning Outcomes: Encryption</h3>
									<p>
										Cryptography was one of the most challenging topics to grasp. However, during this unit, I was able to understand by practicing encryption techniques first hand during the base69 algorithm codio session. I also explored several python modules that encodes and decodes inputted user data using the cryptography.fernet and testing the output of the encrypted text. Since I mostly understand the process of encryption using this function, we are planning to use this technique in our web application to encrypt the user data before sending it to the database. 
									</p>
									<h3>Discussion 2: Cryptography</h3>
									<p>
										TrueCrypt is an open-source encryption tool that was available for operating systems such as windows, Mac and Linux. TrueCrypt provided its users with real-time encryption of data by creating a virtual disk and viewing random data until it is decrypted. In 2014, TrueCrypt was discounted and father maintenance operations were ceased (Roach, 2022).  
									</p>
									<p>
										During the same year, a cryptanalysis conducted on TrueCrypt by Junestam & Guigo (2014) revealed several vulnerabilities, some which are considered high in severity. However, the findings suggest no evidence of intentional malicious code and is rather prone to bugs. From my point of view, I disagree with the authors statement as most of the vulnerabilities that are discovered can be addressed if the code is maintained.  On the other hand, the two main potential weaknesses as revealed by the audit presents a huge factor in determining the software’s reliability: 
									</p>
									<p>
										Volume Header key derivation algorithm:  Weak validation of driver letter symbols. TrueCrypt uses the minimum iteration count using the current algorithm in which brute force attack can be performed. 
									</p>
									<p>
										Sensitive information might be paged out from kernel stacks: A memory overflow can result in stacked data to be paged out to the hard disk. Therefore, allowing the attacker to access non-encrypted confidential data (Baluda, et al., 2015). 
									</p>
									<p>
										In my opinion, I would not recommend TrueCrypt as an encryption solution to a friend because of the lack of maintainability. All initiatives to fix current vulnerabilities in TrueCrypt are stopped, especially after the publishing of the weakness. Newer encryption tools such as VeraCrypt that provides modern security solutions is still maintained.  
									</p>
									<p>
										An ontology capturing TrueCrypt's weakness is presented below:
									</p>
									<span class="image main"><img src="images/O2.png" alt="" /></span>
									<h3>Artefacts: Cryptography With fernet</h3>
									<p>
										A simple encryption program is created using a the fernet algorithm module. The user will input a text to that will be encrypted then decrypted in the terminal window. The functions will use the encode_text() and decode_text()  objects provided by fernet. Please review the code here.

									<h2>Unit 9</h2>
									</header>
									<h3>Team Notes: Week 9</h3>
									<p>
										As we approach the deadline, we setup a series of mini workshops to begin testing our code. First, I had to present the logic behind the HTML that was created to familiarize the team members with the Jinga syntax that connects the html with the python code. Second, we have discussed the front end of the web application, how the users will access the login-page and view the current vulnerabilities pages. This workshop also aims to ensure that all team members have the required Flask packages installed on their system and that the main.py file is connected to Richard’s and Charles databases. 
									</p>
									</hr>




									<header class="major">
									<h2>Unit 10</h2>
									</header>
									<h3>Team Notes: Week 10</h3>
									<p>
										We have conducted many meetings during this week mainly to ensure that Elise’s login and sign-up features are working. We had to test if the user input is recorded, encrypted and sent to the database. There were other challenges that we faced trying to integrate the pyOTP module and the QR code generation to authenticate the user. We tried to work on the popup window that generates the QR code and OTP for authenticating the user. On the other hand, Richard was working to connect his database of current vulnerabilities to the HTML webpage while Charles worked on the admin page that contained the system log information and the registered users tables. We aim to constantly update and debug the main.py file with the new code blocks from each team member. 
									</p>
									<h3>Portfolio Component: Facated Data </h3>
									<p>
										According to Schmitz et al (2016), public and private are two types of faceted data. Failing to ensure secure flow of information may result in a data leakage in both data types. Therefore, faceted values that are assigned to data types protects unauthorised viewers from observing it. Thus, I think it is good practice to protect systems from data leakage, specifically private data. Although this approached contributes to the increased complexity of the code, Schmitz et al (2016) introduces the process of integrating faceted language as a library rather than modifying the actual code.
